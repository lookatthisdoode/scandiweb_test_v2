# Test task for Scandiweb

this is complete working version that i put on hosting
it uses ###index.php as entry point that serves ####root

## Available Scripts


### `npm start`

But nothing will load because you have to run MySQL server too and set it up in PHP/Classes/Database.php file
And Also start PHP server from PHP/Index.php
